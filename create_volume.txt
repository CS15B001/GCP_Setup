1) Create a Disk from the Disks page in GCP
2) Since you have created a new disk, we need to format and add a File System. Run the following command
sudo mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -F -E lazy_itable_init=0,lazy_journal_init=0,discard /dev/[DEVICE_ID]
3) Follow steps 5,6,7 from this link
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#create_disk
4) sudo chmod 777 -R mount/
Use the above command to set all permissions so that you don't have to use sudo anywhere
