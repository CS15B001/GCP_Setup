# AWS_Setup
Set up for Google Cloud Platform

Follow the exact instructions given below.
MuJoCo is perhaps the most unstable package I have ever dealt with, so ironical for a Physics Simulation Engine

1) Choose the following ami in AWS:ami-0189d76e
2) I used the c5.4xlarge instance
3) Run the setup.sh file
4) There are 3 lines mentioned in the end of the file which you might have to do manually. They are related to appening the PATH variables and a sudo reboot may be required in the end

Other than the last manual step, the script takes care of most of the things. Enjoy!
